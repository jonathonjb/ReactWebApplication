            <p>Hi, my name is Jonathon Brandt. I'm a Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology, and I'm planning
                on graduating in the fall of 2021. I'm currently in the process of searching for an internship which allows me to 
                gain some experience in the Software Development field and to expand my skillset. If you'd like to look at some of the 
                projects I've worked on over the past few years, head to my github page: github.com/jonathonjb2015

                During my time with Fidelity Investments, I created a private web application which allows 
                the other Software Engineers on our team to store their project metrics into a database. 
                For this project, I used the React.js library for the front end, and the Node.js runtime 
                environment and the Express.js framework on the back-end.

            <p>
                During my time at RIT, I had a part time job as a tutor. Here, I assisted many students with 
                some of the programming assignments they might be strugling with. I help student understand
                the fundamental Computer Science data structures and algorithms better. For example, some 
                of the topics that were commonly discussed were on: various of different linked lists, stacks and
                queues, trees, heaps and hashtables, as well as algorithms such as the common sorting and path-finding
                algorithms such as the depth-first search, breadth-first search and the A* search algorithms.
